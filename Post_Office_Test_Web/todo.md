# WEB TEST - TODO

```
All Ruby files were written using Ruby version 2.6.3
```

* Clear screen after each calculation. At the moment, if the ```AC``` button is not clicked after each calculation, new numbers pressed will be appended to the previous result. For example: ```12 + 3 = 15```. Then, if pressing the number ```8```, for example, the screen will display ```158``` and use it as the first number.

* Limit the number of digits allowed to the calculator display. If more than 12 digits are types, the numbers will wrap in to two or more lines.

* Implement the ```DEL``` function, to delete one digit at a time.

* Perhaps reducing the size of the '0' digit and add a percentage ```%``` function.
